"Note: The numerator for each percentage is the number of persons arrested for that offense during the 10-year follow-up period, and the denominator is the number released after serving time for each type of commitment offense. For prisoners serving time for more than one offense, the most serious offense is the one with the longest sentence length. Details may not sum to totals because a person may be arrested more than once for different types of offenses and each arrest may involve more than one offense. See appendix table 7 for standard errors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Note: First releases include prisoners released in 2008 for the first time since beginning their sentence and exclude those released under the same sentence who returned to prison for a conditional release violation. For prisoners serving time for more than one offense, the most serious offense is the one with the longest sentence length. Estimates exclude prisoners missing data on type of prison admission. Data on prisoners’ time served were reported for 100% of new court commitments. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. See appendix table 9 for standard errors.",,,,,,,,,,,

# Raw Crime Data

The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) gives access to many sources of government data, including crime data over long periods of time. Large cities across the country maintain their own sites and databases which are accesible through this API.

# Government Programs

Detailed time-series data is not critical here, but rather an understanding of which government programs were executed at what times and by which levels of government. This information provides context to the other datasets such as those on raw crime stats. An important part of the analysis will be comparing the raw data before, during and after these government programs.

# Economic Data

## General Economic Statistics
Economic data can be accessed in similar ways as crime data, as the data needed for this project is maintained by the government. For example, comparing unemployment rate against crime rate could be a useful comparison. This unemployment data would be obtained from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). An example with data from [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) can be seen below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
unrate <- read.csv("data/UNRATE.csv")

plot_ly(x = unrate$DATE, y = unrate$UNRATE, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>%
  layout(title = "United States Unemployment Rate Over Time",
         xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Unemployment Rate"))
```

## Specific Asset Data
![](data/CoreCivic_Logo.png){width="40%"}

When fitting financial time series models, certain stocks can give important information about changes in crime rates due to their relation to crimes. For example, CoreCivic , a company that owns and operates private prisons across the United States, would be a worthwhile stock to look at to attempt to better understand crime rates. This data will be obtained through the `quantmod` package in R.

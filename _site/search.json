    "text": "What is a Time Series?\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular time stamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones. The analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes."

    "text": "The number of arrests made in any city, especially one as large and diverse as New York City, is a figure that is influenced by many variables in addition to time. This means that modelling the number of arrests only on time may result in overlooking valuable information that could be used to fit a model that could forecast arrests even more accurately. Similar work has been done in the past, relating both the economy and labor markets to crime statistics.\nWe will take that approach here, drawing inspiration on the work mentioned in the introduction by Freeman in which he looks at “the way decisions interact in a market setting” (Freeman 1999). He exhibits an important understanding of the influence economic factors have on crime, treating crime rates as another variable in our complex economic system. Looking at the labor market would be beneficial as well, as in the 1980’s and 90’s crime was seen to be closely related to unemployment rates (Gould, Weinberg, and Mustard 2002).\nAnother variable that might be useful to look at is the state of the current election cycle. It is possible that when public officials are up for re-election, they might be more incentivized to take more action to lower crime rates."

There was a slight upward trend towards the end of the 2000’s but that changed dramatically during the 2010’s into a clear downward trend. Since the start of the current decade the trend has reversed course, however. It is hard to tell if the time series is multiplicative or additive, as it seems to hold different characteristics at different points, though this possibly suggests a multiplicative time series. The change in trend could also be part of a longer cycle, though it is impossible to tell from this graph as it only goes back to 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the lag plot up to a lag of 12 months, we can see that the data are clearly not random, as a linear shape exists in each lag that we observe here. Seasonality is harder to observe here, as each month does not appear to be clustered alongside other observations of the same month. This could be due to the large number of points, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look up to a lag of 48 months, we can see that as the lag increases, the data get more random. The Lag 48 plot exhibiting less of a linear pattern than the lag 12 plot, which is fairly linear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the trend here that we were able to observe on the initial graph. There is horizontal movement during the first half of the observed period and then a clear downward trend until 2020. After that, it reverses and increases until the present day.\nRemoving the trend allows us to see some seasonality. Once the seasonality has been averaged out as it has been here, the clear dips in arrests towards the end of each year remain and there is a clear pattern between the large dips at the end of each year.\nThere seems to be more noise in the more recent data, which could be something interesting to look into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF values are decaying towards zero as lag increases, which is evidence that this series needs to be differenced.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikes can be seen at lags of 1, 2, 12, and 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  arrests_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.7629, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.2564\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe ADF tests returns a p-value of 0.26, meaning we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypotheses, the series is not stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detrended series (the middle plot) does not seem to be vastly different from the original series. This could be evidence that there is not much of a trend in the data. The differenced series looks to be stationary, which suggests that there may be a trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ACF has positive spikes at 12, 24, and 36, meaning once the trend is removed, the seasonality becomes evident. The ACF of the differenced time series provides strong evidence in support of seasonality. A SARIMA model would best suit this time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time series follows a very similar pattern to the overall arrests series. There is an upward trend until around 2013 then a downward trend to the minimum value in April 2020, then a sharp increase until today. The data are clearly seasonal as well, seeming to follow a yearly pattern with the yearly minimum happening each winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is the most correlation between lags at a lag value of 12, further increasing evidence for the seasonality of this series. There appears to be less correlation here than in the total time series, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some correlation between yearly lags, meaning this may be a good candidate for seasonal differencing. This correlation appears to decrease as the lag increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition reveals the trend we noticed in the overall plot, with the drop in 2020. The increase and decrease before that point, however, may be less than we initially thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF Plot is decaying towards 0 though there is evidence of seasonality in the correlation between lags.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikes can be seen at lags 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in adf.test(assault_ts): p-value smaller than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  assault_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -4.6813, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe ADF tests returns a p-value of less than 0.01, meaning we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypotheses, the series may be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrending does not change the time series much, suggesting the trend we saw earlier was not as significant as we thought. The time series was stationary before according to the ADF test, meaning differencing did not do much.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evidence of seasonality throughout this process indicates a SARIMA model might be the best for this time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks different from the overall arrests time series. There is a clear negative linear trend in this series, though that trend hit its minimum in July 2020 and has generally been increasing since, though only slightly compared to the initial decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series appears to be highly correlated as all of these lags show high levels of correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the other series, the correlation between lags gets less as the lag increases, though it is still fairly high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series is clearly additive, and the negative trend becomes clear when decomposed. There does appear to be a seasonal component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is evidence against seasonality, and evidence that the series should be differenced.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikes are seen at 1, 2, 3, 8, and 12.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in adf.test(controlled_pos_ts): p-value smaller than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  controlled_pos_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -4.2983, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe ADF test shows that this series may be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrending clearly changes the time series to be more stationary, meaning there is a clear trend. Differencing also moves us closer to a stationary time series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series also seems to have a significant seasonal component, we will fit a SARIMA model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an interesting one, as there is a clear positive trend at the start of the series which quickly reverses when policy changes were made as discussed before. The series eventually goes to zero as marijuana possession is now legal in New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lag plots look different from most others as there is less correlation in lag 12 than in lag 1, suggesting the data may not be seasonal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is very little lag correlation over the 4 year period, even more evidence against seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see the trend observed in the initial plot here in the decomposition. If there were to be a seasonal component it looks to be yearly, but it is hard to tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should difference this series, this ACF plot looks just like the others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a large spike at a lag of 1, then some smaller spikes at 2 and 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  marijuana_pos_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8312, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.2278\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nWe do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, the series may not be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differenced plot looks more stationary, suggesting that differencing may be useful here. The strong seasonal component suggests a SARIMA model would be useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series looks the most stationary out of any so far, there really does not seem to be any patterns to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lag plots support that conclusion, there seems to be little to no correlation between lags at any level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe absence of correlation continues up through high level of lag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe random component looks fairly similar to the observed series, which would make sense for a stationary series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be a slight seasonal component, but it is hard to tell.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are spikes at 1, 2, 3, and 4, and there may be some seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in adf.test(motor_theft_ts): p-value smaller than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  motor_theft_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -5.4308, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nWe do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the series may be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detrended plot looks very similar to the observed plot.

There was a slight upward trend towards the end of the 2000’s but that changed dramatically during the 2010’s into a clear downward trend. Since the start of the current decade the trend has reversed course, however. It is hard to tell if the time series is multiplicative or additive, as it seems to hold different characteristics at different points, though this possibly suggests a multiplicative time series. The change in trend could also be part of a longer cycle, though it is impossible to tell from this graph as it only goes back to 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the lag plot up to a lag of 12 months, we can see that the data are clearly not random, as a linear shape exists in each lag that we observe here. Seasonality is harder to observe here, as each month does not appear to be clustered alongside other observations of the same month. This could be due to the large number of points, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look up to a lag of 48 months, we can see that as the lag increases, the data get more random. The Lag 48 plot exhibiting less of a linear pattern than the lag 12 plot, which is fairly linear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the trend here that we were able to observe on the initial graph. There is horizontal movement during the first half of the observed period and then a clear downward trend until 2020. After that, it reverses and increases until the present day.\nRemoving the trend allows us to see some seasonality. Once the seasonality has been averaged out as it has been here, the clear dips in arrests towards the end of each year remain and there is a clear pattern between the large dips at the end of each year.\nThere seems to be more noise in the more recent data, which could be something interesting to look into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF values are decaying towards zero as lag increases, which is evidence that this series needs to be differenced.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikes can be seen at lags of 1, 2, 12, and 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  arrests_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.7629, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.2564\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe ADF tests returns a p-value of 0.26, meaning we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypotheses, the series is not stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detrended series (the middle plot) does not seem to be vastly different from the original series. This could be evidence that there is not much of a trend in the data. The differenced series looks to be stationary, which suggests that there may be a trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ACF has positive spikes at 12, 24, and 36, meaning once the trend is removed, the seasonality becomes evident. The ACF of the differenced time series provides strong evidence in support of seasonality. A SARIMA model would best suit this time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time series follows a very similar pattern to the overall arrests series. There is an upward trend until around 2013 then a downward trend to the minimum value in April 2020, then a sharp increase until today. The data are clearly seasonal as well, seeming to follow a yearly pattern with the yearly minimum happening each winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is the most correlation between lags at a lag value of 12, further increasing evidence for the seasonality of this series. There appears to be less correlation here than in the total time series, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some correlation between yearly lags, meaning this may be a good candidate for seasonal differencing. This correlation appears to decrease as the lag increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition reveals the trend we noticed in the overall plot, with the drop in 2020. The increase and decrease before that point, however, may be less than we initially thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF Plot is decaying towards 0 though there is evidence of seasonality in the correlation between lags.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikes can be seen at lags 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in adf.test(assault_ts): p-value smaller than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  assault_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -4.6813, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe ADF tests returns a p-value of less than 0.01, meaning we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypotheses, the series may be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrending does not change the time series much, suggesting the trend we saw earlier was not as significant as we thought. The time series was stationary before according to the ADF test, meaning differencing did not do much.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evidence of seasonality throughout this process indicates a SARIMA model might be the best for this time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks different from the overall arrests time series. There is a clear negative linear trend in this series, though that trend hit its minimum in July 2020 and has generally been increasing since, though only slightly compared to the initial decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series appears to be highly correlated as all of these lags show high levels of correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the other series, the correlation between lags gets less as the lag increases, though it is still fairly high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series is clearly additive, and the negative trend becomes clear when decomposed. There does appear to be a seasonal component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is evidence against seasonality, and evidence that the series should be differenced.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikes are seen at 1, 2, 3, 8, and 12.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in adf.test(controlled_pos_ts): p-value smaller than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  controlled_pos_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -4.2983, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe ADF test shows that this series may be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrending clearly changes the time series to be more stationary, meaning there is a clear trend. Differencing also moves us closer to a stationary time series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series also seems to have a significant seasonal component, we will fit a SARIMA model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an interesting one, as there is a clear positive trend at the start of the series which quickly reverses when policy changes were made as discussed before. The series eventually goes to zero as marijuana possession is now legal in New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lag plots look different from most others as there is less correlation in lag 12 than in lag 1, suggesting the data may not be seasonal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is very little lag correlation over the 4 year period, even more evidence against seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see the trend observed in the initial plot here in the decomposition. If there were to be a seasonal component it looks to be yearly, but it is hard to tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should difference this series, this ACF plot looks just like the others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a large spike at a lag of 1, then some smaller spikes at 2 and 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  marijuana_pos_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8312, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.2278\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nWe do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, the series may not be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differenced plot looks more stationary, suggesting that differencing may be useful here. The strong seasonal component suggests a SARIMA model would be useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series looks the most stationary out of any so far, there really does not seem to be any patterns to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lag plots support that conclusion, there seems to be little to no correlation between lags at any level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe absence of correlation continues up through high level of lag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe random component looks fairly similar to the observed series, which would make sense for a stationary series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be a slight seasonal component, but it is hard to tell.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are spikes at 1, 2, 3, and 4, and there may be some seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in adf.test(motor_theft_ts): p-value smaller than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  motor_theft_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -5.4308, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nWe do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the series may be stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detrended plot looks very similar to the observed plot.

    "text": "Crime\nTime-series data for crime throughout the United States is readily available and the variety of attempts the government has made over the years makes looking at how crime has changed over those years an interesting task.\n\n\nBig Picture\nDetermining which attempts by the government at city, state, and national levels have been successful and which attempts have been unsuccessful is an incredibly important task. Doing this will help the government to make better decisions to not only keep people safe, but also put their citizens in the best position to life prosperous lives, arguably the most important role the government can play.\nUnderstanding why criminals commit the crimes they do can help keep citizens safe, but it can also help potential criminals find a better path in life. Being aware of signals that suggest a crime is likely to be committed can help to stop those crimes before they happen. We can also use these data to help address problems that led criminals to commit crimes in the first place. Rehabilitation is an often overlooked part of the criminal justice process and something that can be addressed if we know more about why people commit the crimes they do.\n\n\nLiterature Review\nThere have been countless attempts to understand crime over the years, one interesting one being found in the Handbook of Labor Economics titled “The economics of crime” by Richard B. Freeman. He takes an interesting look at crime through an economic lens, describing this attempt as focusing on “…the effect of incentives on criminal behavior, the way decisions interact in a market setting; and the use of a benefit-cost framework to assess alternative strategies to reduce crime (Freeman 1999). This is a useful approach when looking at time-series data as economic data is possibly the most widely used application of such data.\nThis approach can also be seen when analyzing crime alongside the economy, as this can reveal many motivating factors for committing crime. A 2002 paper demonstrated how the declining labor market in the 1980’s, for example, coincided with increasing crime rates among young men during the same time period. The opposite trend was observed in the following decade (Gould, Weinberg, and Mustard 2002). Papers like these help to bridge the gap between the economy and crime and demonstrate how multi-disciplinary the subject truly is.\n\n\nAnalytical Angles\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n\ndata(Raw Crime Data) --&gt; crime(Model Crime)\ndata --&gt; indicators(Model Economic Indicators)\ndata --&gt; stocks(Model Stocks)\n\ncrime --&gt; intervention(Intervention Analysis)\nindicators --&gt; intervention\nstocks --&gt; intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall process can be seen in the flowchart above and can be understood as follows:\n\nRaw crime data will be obtained\nVarious models including those using just the raw crime data, models with economic indicators as exogenous variables, and financial models with related assets will all be fit.\nThe best and most accurate models from those will be used in an interrupted time series analysis using various events as the interventions to compare the effect those events had on crime rate to determine which events were the most and least successful at impacting those rates.\n\n\n\nGuiding Questions\n\nHow can we use the economy as a means by which to analyze crime data?\nWhat are some metrics we can use to determine the effectiveness of government action?\nAre there changes that we need to make in how we sentence criminals?\nIs it more effective to try and stop crimes before they are commited or to help those who commit crimes after they do so?\nWhat ethical concerns do we need to be aware of if we are attempting to predict who will commit crimes?\nIs action needed the most at the city, state, or federal level?\nIn terms of rehabilitation, are there some people who are simply beyond help?\nIs it worth looking at other countries to see what works and what doesn’t? Or are all countries more or less the same in their relationship with crime?\nWhich area of crime would be the most effective to attempt reform in?\nCould we quantify the negative effect different crimes have on society?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFreeman, Richard B. 1999. “Chapter 52 The Economics of Crime.” In Handbook of Labor Economics, 3:3529–71.

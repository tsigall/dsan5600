    "text": "This graph shows the adjusted closing price for each of the five largest energy companies by market share. They all follow a similar pattern which is to be expected as they are in the same industry. However, it seems like Chevron (CVX) is the most volatile, though this could be due to it being the highest price per share. They are all fairly even on the year, being at a similar place now as they were at the start of the year, though Chevron is down, another difference between it and the rest of the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the temperature at the National Arboretum from January through September in 2021. It follows a predictable pattern, with the highest temps in the summer and lowest in the winter. The lowest temps seem normal, but the high temps seem low. 83 was the highest temp recorded, which is much lower than temps we are having now, for example. This may have something to do with the time it was recorded, as if it was early in the morning then the low temps would be accurate but it would get hotter throughout the day, meaning the high temps are not accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the unemployment rate (percentage of people who are unemployed) in the United States since 1948. Various economic events can be seen, such as the 2008 recession and most notably, the COVID pandemic. There are large spikes in unemployment rate, followed by a more gradual decrease each time. Knowing this, we can assume there was a recession like event in late 1982 when there was a spike even higher than then one in 2008."

    "text": "What is a Time Series?\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular time stamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones. The analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes."

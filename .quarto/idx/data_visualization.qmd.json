In 2014, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio told the NYPD to stop arrests for marijuana possession and instead issue tickets in attempts to decriminalize marijuana [@Dizard_2014]. A drop in arrests is clearly seen around that time period. Around the same time, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation which would allow the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes [@Campbell_2014]. Then, in 2021, recreational cannabis was legalized for adults over 21, up to a specific amount. Since then, the NYPD has not listed any crime related to marijuana, as evidenced by there being no arrests for possession on the graph past 2021.\n\n\n```{r save_data, include = FALSE}\nsave(list = c(\"arrests_by_crime\", \"arrests_by_date\"), file = \"arrest_data.Rdata\")\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include = FALSE}\nlibrary(reticulate)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nuse_condaenv(\"r-env\", required = TRUE)\n```\n\n```{python, obtain_data, include = FALSE}\n# import pandas as pd\n# from sodapy import Socrata\n# import config\n# \n# arrest_data = \"8h9b-rp9u\"\n# client = Socrata(\"data.cityofnewyork.us\",\n#                  config.app_token,\n#                  username=config.username,\n#                  password=config.password)\n# \n# results = client.get(arrest_data, limit=100000)\n# \n# # Convert to pandas DataFrame\n# df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(results)\n# \n# df = df[[\"arrest_date\", \"pd_desc\", \"law_cat_cd\", \"age_group\", \"perp_sex\", \"perp_race\"]]\n```\n\n# New York City Arrests, 2006 - present\n\n```{r visualization, echo = FALSE}\nload(\"arrest_data.Rdata\")\n\ndf<- df %>%\n  mutate(month = month(arrest_date),\n         year = year(arrest_date))\n\narrests_by_date <- df %>%\n  group_by(month = floor_date(arrest_date, \"month\")) %>%\n  summarize(total = n())\n\narrests_plot <- ggplot(data = arrests_by_date, aes(x = month, y = total)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"Arrests in New York City by Date\") +\n  xlab(\"Arrest Date\") +\n  ylab(\"Arrests\")\n\narrests_plot\n```\n\n## By Crime\nIt is important to get an understanding of what types of crimes are commonly committed in New York City, the area we are currently looking at.
